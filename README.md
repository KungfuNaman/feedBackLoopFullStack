ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: failed to create lease: read-only file system
Solution: Sometimes, the Docker daemon might encounter issues that could lead to a read-only file system error. Restarting the Docker service might resolve the problem. You can restart Docker on macOS by clicking the Docker icon in the menu bar and selecting "Restart".


# to run the docker images: 
```docker-compose up --build```
